is provided at [assignment.md](./assignment.md)

# Deliverables
Read the task description in each file.

Design and run prompts (look for all the places labeled TODO in the code). That should be the only thing you have to change (i.e. don't tinker with the model).

Iterate to improve results until the test script passes.

Save your final prompt(s) and output for each technique.

Make sure to include in your submission the completed code for each prompting technique file. Double check that all TODOs have been resolved.
